Here I have trained Mobilenet V2 neural network model with many images of Appy fizz and these are the results. <br/>
Note-
Please follow the provided "fizz.ipynb" to train the neural network<br/>
I have used Google Colab for training purpose so it would be better if you use it.<br/>
If you want the inference graph, then it is in models folder<br/>
